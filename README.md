## Our Story
Alex and I started the StudyLoop app as part of a larger business plan geared towards helping students better collaborate in a convenient group message platform. The major difference is groups are automatically formed based on your current classes for the semester.

We have decided to discontinue our work on StudyLoop but are happy we made it from idea validation to shipping an app on the App Store. We where able to acquire over 200 users within a month of release. Creating StudyLoop has been an incredible learning experience in software development and entrepreneurship. Many thanks to those at [KEC](http://knoxec.com/) and those involved in the [CodeWorks](http://knoxec.com/what-we-do/programs/codeworks/) program for pushing us to deploying a MVP.

This is only the iOS portion of StudyLoop. Alex created the React web app with a Node server for data processing. We utilized Firebase to handle real-time data storage and synchronization.

### The Problem
- Collaboration makes studying more fun and productive for college students
- College students use group messaging apps to collaborate
- No existing app gives students a way to reach _all_ of their classmates
- Students end up with disorganized conversations across multiple apps with only a small circle of classmates

### The Solution

- Immediately reach all your classmates with organized, collaborative messaging
- Select the courses you are in for the semester
- Create and join Loops within a course
- One Loop per tasks (i.e. Homework 4, Exam 2)
- Message classmates within each loop

- Immediately reach all your classmates with organized, collaborative messaging.
