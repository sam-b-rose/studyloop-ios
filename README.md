## Our Story
Alex and I started this app as part of a larger buniess plan geared towards helping students better collaborate in a convient group message like platform but with groups already formed based on your current classes for the semester.

We have decided to discontinue our work on StudyLoop but are happy we made it from idea discovery to shipping an app on the App Store as well as aquiring __over 200__ users within a month of release. It has been an incredible learning experience in the world of software development and entrepranureship. Many thanks to those at [KEC](http://knoxec.com/) and those involved in the [CodeWorks](http://knoxec.com/what-we-do/programs/codeworks/) program for pushing us to deploying a MVP.

### The Problem
- Collaboration makes studying more fun and productive for college students
- College students use group messaging apps to collaborate
- No exisiting app gives students a way to reach _all_ of their classmates
- Students end up with disorganized conversations across multiple apps with only a small circle of classmates

### The Solution

- Immediately reach all your classmates with organized, collaborative messaging
- Select the courses you are in for the semester
- Create and join Loops within a course
- One Loop per tasks (i.e. Homework 4, Exam 2)
- Message classmates within each loop

### App Description

- Immediately reach all your classmates with organized, collaborative messaging.
